This project consists of two parts. Video walkthroughs follow in the next
sections. After completing each part, watch the corresponding walkthrough before
moving forward.

## Instructions

Download the project skeleton below and upload your work when you are finished.

See the "Practice Instructions" reading under W1D1->PROJECTS in the sidebar if
you need help downloading, opening, or uploading the project.

This practice uses RSpec tests to guide and check your work. Run `bundle
install` in your terminal to set up the project. Then run `bundle exec rspec`.
The tests should all fail. Your job is to implement the methods outlined by the
RSpec output. Do this in the corresponding __lib/__ file.

Work until all the specs are green/passing. Look at the __spec/__ files to get
additional clarity or hints on how to satisfy specific specs.

You may find the following RSpec commands useful:

To run all the specs: `bundle exec rspec`  
To run all Part 1 specs: `bundle exec rspec spec/bootcamp_spec.rb:6`  
To run all Part 2 specs: `bundle exec rspec spec/bootcamp_spec.rb:117`  
To run the spec that begins, e.g., on line 8: `bundle exec rspec spec/bootcamp_spec.rb:8`
